# Deep Learning - Project

## Task
The goal of this project is to **compare and demonstrate the advantages of using pretrained neural networks** vs randomly initialized ones for image classification. Build an image classification pipeline for a smaller dataset (e.g. CIFAR-10), and train both a randomly initialized and an ImageNet-pretrained network (e.g. ResNet) for the task. Compare their performance.
