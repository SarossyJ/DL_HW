# Deep Learning - Project

## Task
The goal of this project is to **compare and demonstrate the advantages of using pretrained neural networks** vs randomly initialized ones for image classification. Build an image classification pipeline for a smaller dataset (e.g. CIFAR-10), and train both a randomly initialized and an ImageNet-pretrained network (e.g. ResNet) for the task. Compare their performance.

* **Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition:** [link to paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)

* **Difficulty: Medium**

# Tasks:
- [ ] Setup git, Docker, envs
- [x] Setup Project
- [ ] Implement a basic training for a CNN on CIFAR-10

# Notes
* Do not clutter up .gitignore if possible!
* Use comments, return typing, parameter typing for ease of developement.
* Try to build and keep an orderly project.
